        <h1>How To Play</h1>
        <p>
            <b>How to Play: Hockey Heroes</b><br><br>
            <b>Objective:</b><br>
            Build your ultimate NHL dream team deck, outsmart your opponent, and win rounds by choosing the best player stats in head-to-head matchups!<br><br>
            
            <b>Setup:</b><br>
            - Each player has a deck of NHL player cards.<br>
            - Each card includes key stats (e.g., Goals, Assists, Hits, Saves, Plus/Minus, etc.).<br>
            - Shuffle your deck and draw a starting hand (e.g., 5 cards – customizable based on your rules).<br><br>
            
            <b>Gameplay:</b><br>
            1. Face-Off Turn: Players take turns being the Stat Caller. The Stat Caller picks one stat from their chosen card (e.g., "Goals") for the round’s battle.<br>
            2. Stat Showdown: Both players reveal their selected cards. Compare the chosen stat.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;- The player with the higher stat wins the round and scores a point (or takes both cards, depending on your scoring system).<br>
            3. Next Round: Switch who calls the stat each round and keep the action going!<br>
            4. Deck Management: After each round, players can draw a new card from their deck to replenish their hand (optional rule: manage a limited hand to add strategy).<br>
            5. Trade & Build: Between games, trade cards with friends to strengthen your team and strategize for upcoming battles.<br><br>
            
            <b>Winning the Game:</b><br>
            - First to a set number of points (e.g., 10) wins!<br>
            - Or play until one player runs out of cards—the player with the most points wins.<br><br>
            
            <b>Pro Tips:</b><br>
            - Know your stats! Smart stat choices can swing the game.<br>
            - Build a balanced deck—offensive firepower, defensive anchors, elite goalies—every player counts.<br>
            - Strategize trades to fill gaps and counter your rivals.
